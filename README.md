# Titanic Datasets: Visualizing Data
Visualizing data with Python's Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries.

## About
This project uses Python's Pandas library to read data from the Titanic dataset in a CSV file and store the data in a Pandas dataframe. It then uses the Seaborn library to visualize the data. The result is a scatterplot comparing both age and passenger fare data with those who survived the Titanic.     

## Project Background
The project was built as part of the coursework for Skillcrush's "Preparing & Displaying Data with Python" class.

During this project, I practiced: 

- reading data from a CSV file and storing the data in a Pandas dataframe.

- using the replace() function to clarify and replace select column values in the dataframe for use in the scatterplot's legend.

- using Seaborn to create a scatterplot.

## Built With 
- Python
- CSV module
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
